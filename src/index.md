I am a Masters student studying Computer Science, more specifically studying programming languages

# Interests

As stated previously, I am study programming languages, though this initial description can be a bit vague.
To provide greater detail, I'm mostly interested in all that surrounds the design and implementation of programming languages.
A non exhaustive list would include :
- Parsing
- Compilation
- Interpretation
- Semantics
- Verification

Of course, I do not limit myself to this field only. I am also competent in Software Engineering and Network Protocols, as those are
fields my Masters program allows me to study. Beyond computer science, I am also someone who enjoys partaking in artistic endeavor, 
such as music, 3D modeling, and 3D animation, though I am very much a self-taught amateur in those fields.

I also care for the ethics of computer related technologies ; As such, I gravitate towards the use of Free (as in Freedom) and Open
Source Software, motivate optimisation not only with performance, but also power efficiency, and avoid the mainstream uses of
Generative Machine Learning altogether. Just because others do it, does not mean I should.
Along with that, I am also quite fond of transparency in software, not just through freedom of use or source code availability, but also
via accessibility for the general public. What I mean by that, is that for users to enjoy the freedom of their software, they must
be able to understand what that freedom entails, and how to make use of it. Education is a major factor towards freedom and emancipation,
and to that end, I am more than willing to share my knowledge with everyone, regardless of their initial knowledge in the field.

# Education

- BaccalaurÃ©at, with Mathematics and Physics/Chemistry as primary modules, with high honors
- Double License Mathematics and Computer Science, CS passed with high honors, Math passed with passable mention
- First Year of "Langages et Programmation" Masters with high honors

# Teaching

- I tutor every Friday from 12:30 to 14:30, mainly for L1 and L2 computer science students from Paris-CitÃ©

# ~~Publications~~ Research Projects

> [!NOTE]
> None of the projects shown below are verified, formal publications.
> Those are research projects I've led in the context of specific classes at university, each project corresponding to a different class
> Also, a majority of them were done at a time before I knew to archive and back up my assignments. As such, many will have some
> unfinished aspects or be simply missing after. I have since then learned my lesson.
